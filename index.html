                technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing

                development and operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and
                for building indigenous capability in critical technologies through
                networking of multiple institutions. One of his significant
                contribution was creating Research Centre Imarat for advanced
                technologies. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister and
